# Python (ep_bot)

A personal bot running on discord.

## Running

I would prefer if you don't run an instance of my bot. Just use this [link]().

## Installation

> Please ensure that `python3` will point to a version of python 3.6 or higher.

All of the installation is actually covered in one Python script.
- `python3 install.py`

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- v1.0.0 of discord.py
